    # AI Is Just Digital Plastic

Like plastic it originates from the remains of once magnificent creatures; the remains of the digital life that used to exist on the internet.

These tools can only masquerade as intelligent as they’re just statistics. They consume enormous bodies of data and based on the input given to them guess what the next thing will be.

They have been very effectively marketed to cultivate fear in an already uncertain economic climate. There has always been this idea of labor one day being replaced by robots but now the bad economy almost feels like proof. But the bad economy is not because of these tools, the bad economy is because since People have enough reason to be anxious without these tools. But whether or not we should be anxious is entirely up to us.

but that's a silly fear as there are enough resources they are simply hoarded. The current economic climate really has little to do with these tools or companies. You could use the plastic lawyer but why would you subject yourself to that risk if you were able to afford a real one?

Laypeople still need to look at these statistical tools for what they are. Information hungy idiots that are ushering in an era of incredible plagiarism. And they will never be able to actually think. Only ever guess and never know whether or not a guess is true. Maybe guess again after the first guess. When you know something to be true you kind of just know, these tools can only ever go off of input from others and never actually know anything in the sense that they can readily contradict themselves. They will never be able to think in the human sense. And so long as tasks such as driving require thinking, self-driving cars will never exist. The only way it would be possible for cars to drive themsleves is if we can remove the thinking from driving, it's either that or kiss the dream farewell. But if we remove the thinking we will probably be better off using an algorithm.

Anyone paying attention knows that, like plastic, AI tools are causing more things to be produced at lower quality. It is also starting to look like it may usher in a new era of degradation of our natural environment as an incredible amount resources are being devoted to building more of these tools and finding new applications for these statistical models.

Artisans, thoughtful individuals, artists, and anyone contributing is disincentivized because why make a sacrifice to the algorithms–why endeavor only to have it hidden in a walled garden and usurped by a model - something that the corporations will be able to influence, use, and modify in the pursuit of their own interests. The main platforms are walled gardens now because the they are doing everything that they can to keep contributions within their own walls. One consequence is that Google search has decreased drasticaly in quality. These services are becoming the entrypoint to the internet for many, out of necessity. Over time they will be deliberately biased more and more in the interests of the corporations.

Anything these statistical models do there is very likely a non-statistical (algorithmic) or human way to do that is more beautiful and produces better quality results. It may take more time, but it will likely be better. Whether it’s creating a starting point for a project, searching for information, getting therapeutic advice or help. The metal spoon might be nicer in every way but the plastic one is so much cheaper.

Although the general population is facing a lot of uncertainty the main social issue is the same one before AI, wealth is moving upwards and not around. There is still an infinite amount of useful work to be done and essentially an infinite amount of money in the sense that all money needs to do is change hands but that money is simply being amassed. If your friend working two jobs instead had one and was being paid more they could hire someone to clean their living space and in their spare time could do whatever they wanted and be happier. They could even start their own business, and another consequence would be that the persons friends would have more money to spend on their business. But right now tax law is preventing that from happening like it did before Raegan started a war against the middle and lower class.

There is an effort to use these tools to turn knowledge workers into assembly line workers. While these tools churn things out so fast that knowledge workers have to do their best to just review the incredible output of these tools. And one must understand that the more they output, the more mesmerizing these tools are! The more work they seem to be doing, and the more they can charge. While it is true that many knowledge workers are using these tools to improve their work, the majority of products being produced right now do not appear to have the aim of enabling better work. Most of them seek to enable a larger quantity of work that is lower quality. Professionals who could once take their time now are being forced to move fast and loose as corporations appear to be moving in lock-step as they figure out how much risk to accept from these tools. Corporations appear to prefer to have one knowlege worker who has the impossible task of keeping up with the output of these statistical machines as opposed to three that can do higher quality work. The money saved on the two accountants can be used on legal fees, or charges for whatever consequences once the corporations figure out how much risk to accept. Workers will struggle to keep up fully with what’s going on and have to trust these tools that fundamentally cannot be trusted, because they will only ever be statistical and only be able to guess and guess again to confirm their initial guess. Furthermore, their guesses are biased in the interests of their wardens. There is a real risk that work will start to become fast, unenjoyable, and absurd. Plastic work.

These tools are being ushered in without very much caution. They were adopted at an unimaginable pace. There will likely be problems in the near future because everyone is moving fast and loose right now. Problems arising could lead to knee jerk regulations that will likely be co-opted to establish more of a moat around these corporations.

A lot of the things we use these tools to do should be simplified in the first place. If we need cheaper legal work make the law simpler. Don't make the work plastic. The risk now is that these processes can become even more complicated as these corporations try to leverage these opaque tools to create moats. The same way Intuit made tax law more complicated as a way of creating a moat, it is conceivable that more things can be made more arbitrarily complicated in a way where we are almost forced to rely more on these statistical models to solve them.

The internet was a loose fabric of organic human consciousness. Many of these tools seek to supplant real humans interactions and effectively become the _man_ in the middle. Many laypeople are dazzled, curious, and even slightly confused by what these tools are. Some of the tools are plastic friends, plastic romantic partners, or they provide plastic services. They are interesting and they have certainly been useful to many but they pose a risk. If these corporations have more ownership over our online lives they will use that ownership to more effectively pursue their interests.
