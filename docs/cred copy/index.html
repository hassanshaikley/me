<p>It is not much of a game at this point in time but you can walk around (wasd), open the door (right click), and swing your sword (left click) which can't harm anything.</p>
<p>You can also see other players but they aren't animated well and there may be some bugs!</p>
<p>Regardless I am still proud of this as it was challenging to do without any 3D libraries (only used libraries for matrix math and sockets). This was more or less a custom game engine.</p>
