It is not much of a game at this point in time but you can walk around (wasd), open the door (right click), and swing your sword (left click) which can't harm anything.

You can also see other players but they aren't animated well and there may be some bugs!

Regardless I am still proud of this as it was challenging to do without any 3D libraries (only used libraries for matrix math and sockets). This was more or less a custom game engine.
